# Class Relations Lab

## Objectives
+ Use class syntax to construct objects
+ Use JavaScript iterator methods to build class relations

## Instructions

In the following lab, we want to model our Scuber system in such a way that we can see all of the passengers related to a driver.  A driver becomes related to a passenger when he takes a single trip.  Only one passenger is associated with a trip -- the passenger who books, and pays for the trip on their phone.

Now, for each class that you create, we will first need an incrementing id to keep track of each individual instance of the respective class.  Then we recommending building out the relationship methods.
